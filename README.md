# Overview

Krystal's smart contracts simplify the experience of managing liquidity on concentrated liquidity DEXs, such as 
Uniswap V3 or Quickswap V3, by providing these features:
- **Zap In**: Swap any token and add the resulting liquidity to the pool.
- **Adjust**: Withdraw all liquidity from your current position, including unclaimed fees, and then re-add it to a new position.
- **Compound**: Claim your unclaimed fees and automatically add them back to your current position.
- **Zap Out**: Withdraw all liquidity and unclaimed fees from your position, then swap them to any token. 
Users can use any features above in one single transaction. They can leverage these features through the smart contract 
`V3Utils` for manual control. Alternatively, they can allow Krystal to automate the process through the `V3Automation` smart contract.
